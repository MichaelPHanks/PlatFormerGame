What this project is: A fun (potentially multiplayer) platformer game intended to feel like a Super Mario Bros Wii 

This projects purpose:
	1. For fun
	2. To learn new skills and get better at stuff.
	3. I'm bored asf rn lol
	4. Will make this a multiplayer game if it seems worth it.

This is not made in a game engine because I feel that I would learn more working through the MonoGame framework.

Hoping to have controller input for this game.
